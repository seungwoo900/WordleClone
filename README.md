# WordleClone
I made a wordle clone to practice web development.
It was very good to enhance my javascript skills.

I used wordsapi.com to generate a new random word every time you refresh the page.
I added a keyboard input feature in javascript and a toggle button so that users can change dark/light mode.

You should add an API key from www.wordsapi.com.
You can check it out through open the html file in Live Server.
